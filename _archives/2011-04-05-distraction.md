On productivity, the web, and the human will:

> A new study, done at the University of Copenhagen, asked participants to perform a simple task—watch videos of people passing balls and count the number of passes. But first they were presented with a distraction. One group of participants had a funny video come up on their screens; the rest saw a message telling them that a funny video was available if they clicked a button, but they were told not to watch it. After ten minutes, during which people in the second group could hear those in the first laughing at the video, everyone set to the task of counting the number of passes. And the curious result was that those who hadn’t watched the comedy video made significantly more mistakes than those who had. You might have thought that those who had spent the previous ten minutes laughing would become distracted and careless. Instead, it was the act of following company policy and not clicking that button that eroded people’s ability to focus and concentrate.

> This study is one of the first to look at the specific impact of the Internet on performance, but there have been many similar studies of the limits of people’s will power. A classic experiment involved chocolate-chip cookies and radishes. The subjects of the experiment were told that they were taking part in a taste test, and were put in rooms with a stack of warm cookies and a bowl of radishes. Some of the people were told to eat the radishes, and not to eat the cookies. (To make this harder, they were told to skip a meal before the experiment.) Others were luckier; they were told to gobble up the cookies. Afterward, both groups were asked to solve a complicated puzzle that, unbeknownst to them, had no solution—the experimenters wanted to measure how long people would persist in a frustrating task. Those who had had to eat the radishes and resist the temptation of cookies showed little will power, and gave up after just nine minutes; the cookie-eaters kept going for twice as long. In other studies, people asked not to think of a white bear were considerably worse at solving anagrams than a control group, and people who were told to suppress their emotions while watching a sad movie ate far more ice cream in a taste test afterward than those who had been allowed to express their feelings.

> The basic idea here is that for most people will power is a limited resource: if we spend lots of energy controlling our impulses in one area, it becomes harder to control our impulses in others. Or, as the psychologist Roy Baumeister puts it, will power is like a muscle: overuse temporarily exhausts it.[^fn1]

These studies explain a whole lot more than my relationship to the Internet of work, of course.
