Featured in yesterday's Morning Star, the weekly newsletter from
Wycliffe College, is an editorial by Chris Seitz. Appropriate to the
venue, it includes a few personal reflections. And it sounds a familiar
theme in Seitz's work---"accordance," as the title indicates. 

Brevard Childs' death is mentioned. St Andrews is remembered. Richard
Bauckham's *Eyewitnesses* is commended, and this leads into a brief discussion of Irenaeus on
the accordance of eyewitness testimony with the scriptures.
