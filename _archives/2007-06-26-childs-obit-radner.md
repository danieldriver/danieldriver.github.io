[Ephraim Radner's comment](http://www.kendallharmon.net/t19/index.php/t19/article/3909/#70603)
was pretty well buried among the other responses to Saturday's news.
(That [list](/2007/06/childs-notices-online) has been updated today.) I post it here 
because it's heartfelt and colorful. It also tracks with with Seitz's comment about BTONT's
readership, from [yesterday](/2007/06/childs-dies).

> I am certain of Brevard Childs’ rest with the saints. But he will be

> Scripture’s reality as the Word of God. The movement of renewal he
> inititiated is still in its infancy, and its future for the Christian
> faith and Church still uncharted. I pray we may be worthy of the
> legacy he has left. But I would not be surprised if, when histories

> greatest in the last 50 years. That he fulfilled his vocation while
> being a man of humble faith, prayer, and warm affection for students
> and colleagues is a testimony to the marvelous grace of God. May the
> Lord bless him in His Kingdom, and may our hearts be thankful.
