Jeremy Keith’s *HTML5 for Web Designers* came in the mail yesterday.
It’s short. I was able to read half of it while giving the kid a bath
last night, and the rest this morning. It’s also full of terse, helpful
examples. If you build or tweak anything in HTML but don’t know what to
make of the hype surrounding HTML5, this book is a superb place to
start.

You have to order the book directly from the publisher, at
[abookapart.com](http://www.abookapart.com/), since it doesn’t (yet)
show on Amazon or Google books. Alternately, you can [watch the keynote](http://drupalradar.com/video-jeremy-keith-keynote-session)
Keith gave last month at Drupalcon Copenhagen. (Our uni’s network
administrator put me on to the video, which he found because our
school’s website runs on Drupal.) The video’s hardly shorter than the
book, and less shiny, but it gives a fine overview of some of Keith’s
basic observations. He is, despite his beef with institutionalized
religion, a pretty good evangelist.
