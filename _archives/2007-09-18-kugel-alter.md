James Kugel and Robert Alter, two of the most notable American Hebraists
working today, have both surfaced in mainstream media publications
recently. (This via PaleoJudaica, which mentioned the stories
[here](http://paleojudaica.blogspot.com/2007_09_09_archive.html#3277064988873493836)

The *New York Times*
[reviewed](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/15/us/15beliefs.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=us)
**James Kugel's** gargantuan *[How to Read the
Bible](http://www.amazon.com/How-Read-Bible-Guide-Scripture/dp/074323586X)*
on Saturday. Kugel, who calls himself and [American and a
Zionist](http://www.harvardmag.com/2004/01/final-architect.html), and
who proved his conviction by relocating from Harvard to the Orthodox
[Bar-Ilan Univeristy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar-Ilan_University)
outside Tel Aviv (he says he did it for the tomatoes), has started a web
site in connection with the new book,
[www.jameskugel.com](http://www.jameskugel.com/). The site is a work in
progress, though it does already contain an appendix on "[Apologetics
and Biblical Criticism](http://www.jameskugel.com/apologetics.htm)."

The NYT review focuses on Kugel's thesis that "ancient interpreters" and
"modern scholars" have interpreted the Bible in radically different
ways.

> Charles Augustine Briggs, a 19th-century pioneer of modern biblical
> scholarship, declared that by sweeping away the “rubbish” of centuries
> of biblical interpretation, modern scholars would finally “recover the
> real Bible.” Professor Kugel admires the audacity and genius of
> scholars like Briggs, but he believes that in their contempt for the
> “rubbish” of ancient interpretation, modern scholars have let the
> “real Bible” elude them. They have been left, instead, with “the raw
> material that made up the Bible.”

The reviewer wonders if the two approaches have to be seen as
irreconcilable. Given this summary, I imagine I can see why Kugel was
among the few who came to the Childs session in Vienna this summer
(mentioned near the end of this
[post](http://www.danieldriver.com/blog_files/BSC-fall-2007.php "Blog:Brevard Childs this Fall: Service and SBL Session")).

Yesterday, NPR's All Things Considered (one of the things I miss most
about commuting in the US of A) broadcast [Robert
Siegel](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2101185)'s
interview of **Robert Alter**, about his new translation of the
[Psalms](http://www.amazon.com/Book-Psalms-Translation-Commentary/dp/0393062260/ref=sr_1_1/105-5360461-0234044?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1190132399&sr=1-1).
In the interview Alter explains why "soul" is a bad translation of
"nephesh." Translations can be "like those thick layers of veneer that
were put down on paintings in the Victorian period so you couldn't see
the true colors." They impose later ideas about the division of body and
soul, or about the soul surviving after death, onto the ancient text. "I
scrupulously avoided 'soul' in order not to give the wrong impression."

Alter also reads Psalm 8, drawing attention to translation choices that
aim to preserve the strong rhythms and compactness of the original
Hebrew. He comments about the strange mythical language preserved in
Psalm 82, which has God among the gods. "Our God, the big guy, presides
over the assembly." He summarizes the message to the small-g gods:
"You're going to be demoted to human status because you haven't done
your job of administering justice."

[Listen](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=14476326)
to the entire interview. It's not long. NPR also includes an excerpt of
Alter's translation and commentary on Psalm 23.

Very much looking forward to browsing both books when I can get my hands
on them.

POST SCRIPT (20 Sept): Kugel's [online
appendix](http://www.jameskugel.com/apologetics.htm) is worth reading.
In it he actually goes after Alter a bit (similarly Jon Levenson, whose
*Death and Resurrection of the Beloved Son* I reviewed just last night),
proving that the alignment which brought them together here does not
entail alignment in other matters—obviously.

Professor Kugel, if you should happen to find this, thank you for your
efforts on your web page, especially for publishing some real content
there.
