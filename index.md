Greetings from Halifax, Nova Scotia. My name is [Daniel Driver](about/), and I am a Professor of Old Testament at Atlantic School of Theology, where I also serve as Director of the Master of Arts program. Conjointly with [Saint Maryâ€™s University](https://www.smu.ca/academics/m-a-theology.html), we offer an [MA in Theology and Religious Studies](https://www.astheology.ns.ca/future/graduate/ma-theology-religious-studies.html). Want to write a Master's thesis at AST? Please [contact me](about/#contact) to inquire.

I teach an [array of courses](courses/) across the Law, Prophets, and Writings.
My [academic publications](work/) have focused on canonical approaches to scripture, especially in the tradition of [Brevard Childs](bsc/). At present I am completing an edition of Childs's collected essays, soon to appear with Mohr Siebeck ([FAT I](https://www.mohrsiebeck.com/en/monograph-series/forschungen-zum-alten-testament-fat)).
Other major aspects of my current work converge on Genesis, the Psalms, and creation.

Very occasionally I publish [short notes](notes/) here, on what once might have passed for a blog. In 2021 I finally took Jaron Lanier's advice and deleted my social media accounts. I still exist.
