<div class="lead pretty-links">
  Greetings from Halifax, Nova Scotia. My name is [Daniel Driver](about/), and I am a Professor of Old Testament at Atlantic School of Theology, where I have taught since 2016.

  As the only full-time professor in this field at AST, I teach an [array of courses](courses/) across the Law, Prophets, and Writings.
  My [academic publications](work/) have focused on canonical approaches to scripture, especially in the tradition of [Brevard Childs](bsc/). At present I am completing an edition of Childs's collected essays, scheduled to appear with Mohr Siebeck ([FAT I](https://www.mohrsiebeck.com/en/monograph-series/forschungen-zum-alten-testament-fat)) in 2021.
  Other major aspects of my current work converge on Genesis, the Psalms, and creation.

  Very occasionally I publish [short notes](notes/) here, on what once might have passed for a blog. In 2021 I finally took Jaron Lanier's advice and deleted my social media accounts. I still exist.
