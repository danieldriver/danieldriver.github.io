<div class="lead pretty-links">
  Greetings from Halifax, Nova Scotia. My name is [D.&#8239;R.&nbsp;Driver](about/), and since August 2016 I have been Associate Professor of **Hebrew Bible/Old Testament** at the Atlantic School of Theology.

  As the only full-time professor in this field at AST, I teach an [array of courses](courses/) across the Law, Prophets, and Writings.
  My [academic publications](work/) have focused on canonical approaches to scripture, especially in the tradition of [Childs](bsc/).
  Several aspects of my current work seem to converge around the Book of Genesis.
  Very occasionally I publish [short notes](notes/) here, on what once might have passed for a “weblog,” on any number of topics.

  I also maintain [lente.net](http://lente.net), a website named for the oxymoronic motto *festina lente* and dedicated to an ecumenical pursuit of things biblical and theological.
