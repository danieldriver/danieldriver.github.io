# DRD's Personal Website

My website has a long history. In its latest incarnation is built on a
fork of the [Jackal theme][1] ![](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/express.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=flat-square)
for Jekyll. I have taken the liberty of modifying it for my own purposes.

If you want to fork the theme for yourself, I recommend that you start
with the generic template put together by [clenemt][1]. I understand
that the MIT License covers the software for this website, and not the
content which I put up on it. Regarding the website content, I assert my
moral right to be identified as the author of this work. It is subject
to the applicable copyright laws.

# Usage

Be sure to have both `jekyll` and `jekyll-paginate` gem installed.

Locally, in a terminal app:

```
$ jekyll serve
```

The Jackal theme supports the Front Matter options

for **pages**:
* title (the page title)
* subtitle (the page h1)
* desc (for a SEO description /= excerpt)

for **posts**:
* microtitle (for a page title /= title)
* desc (for a manual excerpt and SEO description)

See [Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) and [configuration](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/) for more information.
