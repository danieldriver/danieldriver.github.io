I'm in the process of moving this site to a new host, to enable some back-end processes that my old host does not allow. For a little while yet the bulk of the old site is mirrored at <http://danieldriver.ehclients.com/>. Most of the core files are here, though some of the archives are missing yet.

Thanks for your patience, and please let me know if anything on the new site is absent or out of place.
