Early this fall there will be a public [memorial
service](http://www.yale.edu/divinity/news/070625_news_childs.shtml) for
Brevard Childs. It will take place on Tuesday, 25 September, at 5:00, at
Yale Divinity School in Marquand Chapel. A reception will follow in the
common room. (I'd try to attend if I weren't a continent away.)

Later, at the November SBL Congress in [San
Diego](http://www.sbl-site.org/Congresses/Congresses_ProgramBook.aspx?MeetingId=7),
a panel will reflect on his career. The members of the panel are still
to be announced, though I know at least Christopher
Seitz is involved. As it stands on the SBL site today, the details are:

> *S18-50*
>
> ## Reflections on Brevard Childs
>
> *11/18/2007*
> 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
> Room: 30 E - CC

> A panel of scholars, in light of Child's death in July 2007, is being
assembled. The panel will reflect on the contributions of Brevard
Childs' career. Among the topics to be covered will be his influence on
form criticism, reception history, Old Testament introductions, New
Testament studies, and theology.

As I am giving a paper there the day before, I do of course plan to be
in attendance. A much smaller session was hosted in Vienna (on
Wednesday, 25 July 2007), thanks to quick arrangements by Kent Richards.
Memorable comments after Seitz's paper included those of James Kugel and
Erhard Gerstenberger. The latter recalled splitting some obstinate wood
for the Childs household on one visit to Yale, and contributing a
critical essay to the first Childs FS that was nevertheless received
with warmth and gratitude.

Because a little more time has passed, the November session promises to
be more comprehensive, and more directed to Childs' diverse scholarly
efforts.

In Vienna there was also a session for James Barr. I am sorry that it
does not look like a similar session has been planned for him in San
Diego.
