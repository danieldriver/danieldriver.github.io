System Font Library (net +4)
----------------------------

The `/System/Library/Fonts/` folder nets four more items (up to 43 in
Mavericks from 39 in Mountain Lion). The number includes five new
TrueType Collection files (`.ttc`) and a compression of two TrueType
font files (`.ttf`) from OS 10.8 into one `.ttc` file in OS 10.9. All
additions are promoted from the larger computer font library.

### Promotions (+5)

- Avenir Next Condensed.ttc
- Avenir Next.ttc
- Avenir.ttc
- Optima.ttc
- Palatino.ttc

These promotions certainly make sense. As modern classics, Avenir,
Optima and Palatino all have a rightful spot in the list of the [100
Best Typefaces of All Times][100best] (ranked 65th, 11th and 38th,
respectively). Until now I had not noticed that Apple offers its users
both the original Optima, designed by Adrian Frutiger in 1988, and its
2004 revision by Akira Kobayashi. I know that Avenir Next adds the small
caps that its predecessor lacks. Having both together invites further
comparison.

TK: did apple fill out the description for Avenir? It's quite detailed.

Avenir reads:

> Adrian Frutiger designed Avenir in 1988, after years of having an
> interest in sans serif typefaces. In an interview with Linotype, he
> said he felt an obligation to design a linear sans in the tradition of
> Erbar and Futura, but to also make use of the experience and stylistic
> developments of the twentieth century. The word Avenir means 'future'
> in French and hints that the typeface owes some of its interpretation
> to Futura. But unlike Futura, Avenir is not purely geometric; it has
> vertical strokes that are thicker than the horizontals, an "o" that is
> not a perfect circle, and shortened ascenders. These nuances aid in
> legibility and give Avenir a harmonious and sensible appearance for
> both texts and headlines. In 2004 Adrian Frutiger and the type
> director of Linotype GmbH  Akira Kobayashi reworked the Avenir and
> created the Avenir Next for the Platinum Collection. 

And Avenir Next [Condensed] adds:

> It includes new small caps, newly designed true italics, and a
> complete new range of weights. Avenir Next [Condensed] is a versatile
> sans serif family, ready for large and complex projects from books to
> signage to advertising.

### Compressions (-1)

- Thonburi.ttc
    * The typeface now includes Light, Regular and Bold.
    * The font file subsumes Thonburi.ttf and ThonburiBold.ttf from 10.8.

Otherwise the core system fonts are identical.

Computer Font Library (net +27)
-------------------------------

The `/Library/Fonts/` folder nets 27 more items (up to 230 in Mavericks
from 203 in Mountain Lion). This difference actually masks the gross
number of new fonts (42), since, compared with OS 10.8, the font files
are reduced in three ways in OS 10.9. There are removals for promotion
to the system library, compressions of `.ttf` files into `.ttc`
collections, and outright deletions.
