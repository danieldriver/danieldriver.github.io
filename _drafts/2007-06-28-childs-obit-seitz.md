Christopher Seitz has written a [laudatory obituary](http://www.sbl-site.org/Article.aspx?ArticleId=691 "SBL Obituary") 
for the SBL website. An excerpt:

> Childsâ€™s control of the history of ideas, especially continental
> scholarship; his immersion in the apparatus of classical theological
> reflection from the Reformation period and from the wider history of
> biblical interpretation; his technical training in Hebrew language;
> and his deep love of and concern for the church, and the way the Bible
> made its renewing voice heard, as the speech of God for every age:
> these characteristics of the man and his work mark him off as a
> scholar whose best analogies are to be found in figures like Jerome,
> Chrysostom, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, or his teacher from a more recent
> day, Karl Barth. No one who ever heard him lecture will forget his
> carefully composed prayers, and no one who heard him preach or pray
> will have failed to note a man of great learning, humility, Godly
> fear, and deep Christian hopefulness. 
> 
> ...
> 
> As we mark and mourn his passing, we lean into the confident hope that
> Brevard Childs will be read and heard, and his work continued, well
> beyond the years he gave us. He was never a man to call attention to
> himself, but rather to point to the God who in every generation raised
> up women and men of faith, to extend the legacy of prophet and apostle
> in their own way, in their own generation. This challenge never failed
> to energize Brevard Childs, and we who give thanks for his life do so
> in gratitude to the God who sent him and gave us these years of
> service and proclamation, always to his greater glory. 
> May God grant him joy and rest eternal with his saints from every age.
