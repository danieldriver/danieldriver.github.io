title: Data under water, diesel on the stairs

As Hurricane Sandy approached the eastern seaboard last night, I had to convert all the new knowledge I'd looked up about tropical storms, and passed on to our preschool-aged daughter, into reasons not to be afraid. It was storming outside our window, and she was bawling.

"It's hundreds of miles away from us," I said. "Mommy and I will watch, and we will always make sure you're safe. Come to think of it, we're probably safer in our apartment than in a house. The security guys downstairs will sound the alarm if there's any serious danger."

"I don't *ever* want to leave this building," she sputtered between sobs.

Like many people I wondered what the damage would be, how directly we'd be affected, if the lives of any we knew would be undone.

*And what if the storm takes out 60 Hudson Street?* I thought, picturing the [carrier hotel][hudson] in Manhattan that is one of the world's key fiber-optic hubs. *Wake up, and the internet's down. That could be pretty pervasive.*

As we've been hearing and reading all day, the storm has been devastating. Turns out that 400 miles isn't too far away, either, if the storm system's big enough.[^times] Trees and power lines are down across Ontario and Quebec (tens of thousands of homes are still without power), and a Toronto woman died last night when she was struck by a red Staples sign.

[^times]: As the NY Times [reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/31/us/hurricane-sandy-barrels-region-leaving-battered-path.html?pagewanted=2&_r=0&hp), "At one point, hurricane-force winds extended up to 175 miles from the center of the storm; tropical-storm-force winds spread out 485 miles from that center."

A corpse and a few smashed cars are minor compared to the aftermath in New England. Most people in Toronto today woke up, reset their clocks, and sighed in relief as they went about their days as planned. "Toronto often laments the fact that New York City does things bigger and more lavishly," wrote the [Torontoist][toist], "but this is not one of those times."

The internet felt the effects of the storm as well. Gizmodo.com went offline, for example --- and sounded rather glib about it, though neither the Onion nor Jerry Falwell's ghost have tried the obvious headline: "Almighty Wreaks Judgment on Gizmodo, Jersey Shore."

My own personal web host has threatened to go down all day. *Maybe the fallout for me,* I thought, *will be the trivial matter of students unable to fully prepare for class, since the site I ask them to use is served up from New York.* To my amazement, Squarespace has been up all day.

I don't know if any part of 60 Hudson St is under water --- it certainly could be --- but I learned that the lobby and basement of 75 Broad St, a data colocation center where some of my data lives, certainly is.

[Google's crisis map](http://google.org/crisismap/2012-sandy) and that of the [Times](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/images/newsgraphics/2012/1029-hurricane-updates/subway1030.jpg) suggest that the Pier1 colo was more at risk of flooding that the city's carrier hotel, but it's a matter of blocks.[^waver]

[^waver]: On the other hand, since 2006 the TriBeCa building has had a [city variance](http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/nyregion/18tanks.html) allowing them to store some 5,000 gallons of diesel fuel on six floors above basement level, out of a total 80,000 gallons. This provision should help them avoid the crisis that Pier1 is facing.

At around noon today Squarespace clients got an [email](http://blog.squarespace.com/sandy) from the company founder and CEO, Anthony Casalena.

> Our primary data center, Peer1, in Lower Manhattan lost power yesterday at about 4:30PM local time. At that time, we smoothly made the transition to generator power and took comfort over the fact that we had enough fuel to last three to four days. (Peer1 stayed online during the last 3 major natural disasters in the area, including a blackout that lasted for days.)
> 
> At 8:30PM yesterday, we received reports that the lobby in the data center’s building was beginning to take on water. By 10:30PM, as is sadly the case in most of Lower Manhattan, Peer1’s basement had experienced serious flooding. At 5AM, we learned our data center’s fuel pumps and fuel tanks were completely flooded and unable to deliver any more fuel. At 8AM, they reported that the generators would be able to run for a maximum of four more hours.
> 
> Unfortunately, this means that Squarespace will be offline soon (our estimate being at 12PM today). Be assured that while this will impact our availability, there is no chance of data loss or any other permanent effects. We have simply run out of power, backup power, and cannot access our fuel in a flooded basement.
> 
> Our teams have been working tirelessly on contingency plans. We are working to bring the Squarespace systems back online as soon as possible. As you have probably read, all bridges and tunnels into and out of Manhattan are closed and large portions of the city remain without power. We will do everything in our power to get Squarespace running as soon as possible, and we will remain online for as long as it is safe.

Casalena has continued to post [updates](http://blog.squarespace.com/hurricane-sandy-update) on the company blog, including this:

> Bridges to the island are open right now, and we currently have a fuel truck en route. We have approval from the building to manually carry fuel up in plastic water bottles, and we have a number of our team on-site to carry fuel up the stairs as needed. I do not know if the manual plan will be successful, but we will certainly try.
>
> Unfortunately, I do not have more information on a final resolution to this issue. You should still expect Squarespace to go offline at some point because of the hurricane’s aftermath, but we will do our best to keep that downtime to a minimum. Once we have a reliable stream of fuel to the building, it will go online independently of any other grid issues related to ConEdison and lower Manhattan in general.

The thought of a tech company's employees carrying diesel gasoline up to the 17th floor just to keep their services running strikes me as incredible and, well, a bit unnecessary. Mine is a hobby site, in the main, and so I might feel differently if I were relying on them to serve up the storefront of a small business. Then again, when a nearby hospital has to be evacuated because its backup power supply fails, I tend to think that a lapse in uptime can be forgiven.

If people have been carrying infants and invalids down flights of hospital stairs, to get them to hospitals that are online, and if others are rushing drums of fuel up stairs, to the generators that power servers with my data on it, then the least I can do is blog about it. Dedicated people have gone to great lengths so you can read this.
