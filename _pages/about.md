Born in Portland, Oregon in 1979, Daniel Driver studied English
Literature at university (BA from Wheaton College, 2002), taught
humanities to high school students in Kansas for two years, and then
moved to St Andrews, Scotland, to pursue graduate work in theology.
There he completed a PhD in Divinity, with a focus on Old Testament, in
mid-2008. From 2008 to 2016 he taught Hebrew and Old Testament to
undergraduates at Tyndale University College, in Toronto. While there
was confirmed in the Anglican Church of Canada at the Cathedral Church
of St. James. One of the things that excites him about joining the
faculty of the [Atlantic School of Theology](http://www.astheology.ns.ca/faculty/full-time/daniel-driver.html)
in Halifax, from August 2016, is the way that his service to church and
academy has been formally linked to the <abbr title="Anglican Church of
Canada">ACC</abbr> in a broadly and self-consciously ecumenical
environment.
