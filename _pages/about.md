Born in Portland, Oregon in 1979, Daniel Driver studied English
Literature at university in Chicago, taught humanities to high school
students in Kansas for two years, and then moved to St Andrews,
Scotland, to pursue graduate work in theology. There he completed a PhD
in Divinity, with a focus on Old Testament. From 2008 to 2016 he taught
Hebrew and Old Testament to undergraduates in Toronto, Ontario. In 2016
he joined the faculty of [Atlantic School of Theology](http://www.astheology.ns.ca/faculty/full-time/daniel-driver.html)
in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One of the things he enjoys about working with
colleagues and graduate students at AST is the way that his service to
church and academy is formally linked to the Anglican Church of Canada
in a broadly and self-consciously ecumenical environment.
