*Fall 2021: Offered at AST and Online (Hybrid)*

### Course Description

A study of creation across the Christian Bible, with particular
focus on the HB/OT, this course will explore why the topic of
creation has been sidelined in biblical studies and biblical
theology, and how, thanks in part to the ecological crisis, it is
getting new attention. Major headings in the course are creation,
counter-creation, de-creation, and re-creation. Minor themes include
sabbath, sea monsters, land, city, wisdom, and praise.

* Prerequisites: RM 1000 or GTRS 6000; BF 1001.
* Requirements: Weekly readings, weekly discussions, a presentation, two short papers.

## Required Texts (Fall 2021)*

The following texts are required. Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase their own copies. Library copies that are not reference works
will be placed on a 2-hour reserve in the [AST Library](http://www.astheology.ns.ca/library/index.html).

A Bible, either **NRSV** or **NJPS** translation
: There are many editions, and you may already own one that will serve well. If you want a study Bible, consider the NJPS alternative described below. Its supplementary notes and essays are exceptional. You may also prefer a Bible without all the commentary (as I usually do).
: **NRSV** Study Bible: Michael Coogan, ed. [*New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha: New Revised Standard Version*](https://amzn.to/2qpjO6P). 5th ed. Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2018.
: **NRSV** Text Only: I find I generally only want the text itself (it's far more portable, and notes can get in the way). In that case, get a [version like this instead](https://amzn.to/34xOeCI).
: **NJPS** Study Bible: Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, eds., [*The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition*](https://amzn.to/36BBqNw) (Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2014).

Levenson, Creation and the Persistence of Evil

Tanner, God and Creation in Christian Theology
