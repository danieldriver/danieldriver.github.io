*Summer 2025: Offered on AST's Campus in Session 2*

### Course Description

A study of creation across the Christian Bible, with particular focus on the HB/OT, this course will explore why the topic of creation has been sidelined in biblical studies and biblical theology, and how, thanks in part to the ecological crisis, it is getting new attention. Four major headings in the course are creation, counter-creation, de-creation, and re-creation. Related themes include sea monsters, land, sabbath, the city, wisdom, and praise.

- Prerequisites: [BF 1001](../bf-1001/); RM 1000 or GTR 6000.
- Requirements: Weekly readings, weekly discussions, a creative presentation, two papers. The course includes an arts component.
- Syllabus: Pending for Summer 2025.
