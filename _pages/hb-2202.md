*Offered at AST, Winter 2019*

## Course Description

*From the Academic Calendar*: A more detailed study of Hebrew grammar
and syntax through the reading of selected biblical texts, this course
is designed as a continuation of HB 2201. For a complete introduction,
students will continue through two semesters of study. In the second
semester emphasis will fall on less regular paradigms (learned
inductively) and more complicated syntax. The basic goal of the entire
course is for students to become proficient in the rudiments of biblical
Hebrew, sufficient for the independent reading of biblical books.

*Prerequisites: [HB 2201](../hb-2201/) and [BF 1001](../bf-1001/) (or equivalent).*

*Requirements: Weekly assignments and in-class work, regular vocabulary
quizzes, annotated translations of three or four chapters from the
Bible.*


## Required Texts (Winter 2019)
