## Course Description

A more detailed study of Hebrew grammar and syntax through the reading
of selected biblical texts, this course is designed as a continuation of
HB 2201. For a complete introduction, students will continue through two
semesters of study. In the second semester emphasis will fall on verbs,
especially the less regular paradigms, and on more complicated syntax.
The basic goal of this course is for students to become proficient in
the rudiments of biblical Hebrew, sufficient for the independent reading
of biblical books in this language.

(Note: This course is open to undergraduate students from other
universities. Please contact the Registrar to enroll as a Letter of
Permission student.)

## Required Texts (Winter 2021)*

: Note that LBH has a [companion site with resources for teachers and students](http://www.learningbiblicalhebrew.com/). You can order the [Learning Biblical Hebrew Bundle (2 vols.)](https://lexhampress.com/product/177582/learning-biblical-hebrew-bundle) directly from the publisher, in print or digital format. I would recommend getting the Reader in print format, since you want to write out the exercises, but it might be useful to have both formats of the Reader if you want to use a digital format for the Grammar.
