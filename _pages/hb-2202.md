*Offered at AST, Winter 2019*

## Course Description

A more detailed study of Hebrew grammar and syntax through the reading
of selected biblical texts, this course is designed as a continuation of
HB 2201. For a complete introduction, students will continue through two
semesters of study. In the second semester emphasis will fall on less
regular paradigms (learned inductively) and more complicated syntax. The
basic goal of the entire course is for students to become proficient in
the rudiments of biblical Hebrew, sufficient for the independent reading
of biblical books.

*Prerequisites: [HB 2201](../hb-2201/) and [BF 1001](../bf-1001/) (or equivalent).*
