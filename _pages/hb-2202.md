## Course Description

The natural continuation of HB 2201, this course is for those who wish
to have a complete introduction to the basics of biblical Hebrew.
Students will progress through encounters with less regular paradigms
and more complicated syntax, building confidence as they master select
readings from Genesis. The goal of the full course series, in two parts,
is a proficiency in the rudiments of Hebrew that is sufficient for the
independent reading of biblical books.

- Prerequisites: [HB 2201](../hb-2201/).
- Requirements: Daily assignments and in-class work, periodic quizzes, one or two longer interpretive exercises or exams.
- Syllabus for Winter 2025 (v. 3.7): [Download the latest version](https://github.com/danieldriver/Syllabi/raw/master/HB/HB2202-Driver2025.pdf).

## Required Texts (Winter 2025)*

LBH Grammar
: Karl V. Kutz and Rebekah Josberger. *Learning Biblical Hebrew: Reading for Comprehension: An Introductory Grammar.* Bellingham, WA: Lexham, 2018. ISBN 978-1683590842.
: Note that LBH has a [companion site with resources for teachers and students](http://www.learningbiblicalhebrew.com/). You can order the [Learning Biblical Hebrew Bundle (2 vols.)](https://lexhampress.com/product/177582/learning-biblical-hebrew-bundle) directly from the publisher, in print or digital format. I would recommend getting the Reader in print format, since you want to write out the exercises, but it might be useful to have both formats of the Reader if you want to use a digital format for the Grammar.
