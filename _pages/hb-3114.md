## Course Description

Ben Sira writes of “the bones of the Twelve Prophets,” asking that they
may “send forth new life from where they lie, for they comforted the
people of Jacob and delivered them with confident hope” (Sirach 49:10).
It is a tantalizingly early reference to the association of Twelve
Prophets brought together in the Hebrew Bible’s last book of Prophets, a
collection later known as The Book of the Twelve. It is also a pregnant
anticipation of the manifold ways in which the words of these prophets
have spoken far beyond their original circumstances.

To better understand the origins and impact of The Book of the Twelve,
this course will look at its redactional history and editorial shaping,
its final canonical forms, and its effects as biblical prophecy. It will
introduce current issues in scholarly debate about The Twelve while also
exploring ways that The Twelve meet the ancient expectation that they
can “send forth new life” amidst the people of God. In broad terms, the
course offers an encounter with several individual texts embedded in a
wider biblical tradition, and an opportunity to see how together “the
goodly fellowship of the Prophets” witnesses to long-term works of
providence as judgment and mercy converge in “the great and terrible Day
of the Lord” (Malachi 4:5).
