## Course Description

To better understand the origins and impact of the book of the Twelve Prophets, this course will look at its redactional history and editorial shaping, its final canonical forms, and its effects as biblical prophecy. It will introduce current issues in scholarly debate about the Twelve while also exploring ways that they meet the ancient expectation that their “bones” can “send forth new life” amidst the people of God (Sirach 49:10).

*Requirements: Weekly readings, weekly discussions, a presentation, two short papers.*
