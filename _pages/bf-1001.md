*Offered Online, Winter 2020*

### Course Description

The First Testament of Christian Scripture, also called the Hebrew Bible
or Old Testament, is a fundamental part of Christian tradition and
durable rule of faith and practice. Students in this course will
therefore be introduced to historical and literary data important for
understanding the origins of the Hebrew Bible and its subsequent
function as Old Testament Scripture in a variety of cultural and
religious contexts.

The broad sweep of biblical tradition will be presented through a survey
of representative books from the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. To
help foster an ecumenical outlook, primary readings from the Bible will
be supplemented by case studies of classic Jewish and Christian readings
of biblical texts. Students will develop their exegetical skills by
studying these examples, and so learn to appreciate the diverse
literary, canonical, cultural, historical, hermeneutical, and
theological elements involved in biblical interpretation. In addition,
the course will consider some ways that the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament
can feature in the practice of ministry and in the spiritual practice of
faith communities.

### Course Objectives

By the end of the course students should be able to:
	name major Old Testament people and events;
	locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
	give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from Egypt to Greece;
	recognize and cite examples of most genres of biblical literature;
	understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
	report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets, such as the uses of the Divine Name or the rationales for sabbath observance;
	classify a variety of ancient and modern approaches to the Bible, including traditional “plain sense” and figural reading strategies as well as historical criticism and its legacy.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
Scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities, recognize
where their own biographies place them in relation to the Hebrew
Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their individual
attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend their awareness
of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's long history of
reception. Finally, students should begin to infer what Jesus meant in
speaking of "the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms" (Luke
24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New Testament fulfilment of
scripture in light of the unique voice that the Old Testament retains
along side of the New in Christian Scripture.


## Required Textbooks (Fall 2018)*

The following texts are required (Fall 2018).* Students are strongly
encouraged to purchase their own copies. Library copies that are not
reference works will be placed on a 2-hour reserve in the [AST Library](http://www.astheology.ns.ca/library/index.html).

A Bible, either **NRSV** or **NJPS** translation.
: There are many options, and you may already own something that will work very well. If you want a study Bible, I urge you to consider the NJPS alternative described below. In my view its the best in class. You may also prefer a Bible without all the commentary (as I usually do).
: **NRSV** Study Bible: Michael Coogan, ed. [*New Oxford Annotated Bible with Apocrypha: New Revised Standard Version*](https://amzn.to/2qpjO6P). 5th ed. Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2018. The NRSV is a standard translation in the academy and in many of the churches affiliated with AST. It features gender inclusive language (though not for God). The notes and essays can be helpful, though they do add considerably to the heft of the volume. This version includes the entire Christian Bible (OT and NT), plus the Apocrypha. It should be useful to you in many other courses at AST.
: **NRSV** Text Only: I find I generally only want the text itself (it's far more portable, and notes can get in the way). In that case, get a [version like this instead](https://amzn.to/34xOeCI).
: **NJPS** Study Bible: Adele Berlin and Marc Zvi Brettler, eds., [*The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition*](https://amzn.to/36BBqNw) (Oxford / New York: Oxford University Press, 2014). A superb alternative to the NRSV, equally well-regarded in the academy but not well known in the church, the notes and supplementary essays in this study Bible are best in class. The single-column layout is easier to read, too. The main drawback is that it lacks the NT and Apocrypha (for obvious reasons), and so may prove less useful in other courses at AST.
