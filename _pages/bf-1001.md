*Offered at AST, Fall 2018*

### Course Description

*From the Academic Calendar*: The First Testament of Christian
Scripture, also called the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, is a
fundamental part of Christian tradition and durable rule of faith and
practice. Students in this course will therefore be introduced to
historical and literary data important for understanding the origins of
the Hebrew Bible and its subsequent function as Old Testament Scripture
in a variety of cultural and religious contexts.

The broad sweep of biblical tradition will be presented through a survey
of representative books from the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. To
help foster an ecumenical outlook, primary readings from the Bible will
be supplemented by case studies of classic Jewish and Christian readings
of biblical texts. Students will develop their exegetical skills by
studying these examples, and so learn to appreciate the diverse
literary, canonical, cultural, historical, hermeneutical, and
theological elements involved in biblical interpretation. In addition,
the course will consider some ways that the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament
can feature in the practice of ministry and in the spiritual practice of
faith communities.

### Course Objectives

By the end of the course students should be able to:
	name major Old Testament people and events;
	locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
	give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from Egypt to Greece;
	recognize and cite examples of most genres of biblical literature;
	understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
	report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets, such as the uses of the Divine Name or the rationales for sabbath observance;
	classify a variety of ancient and modern approaches to the Bible, including traditional “plain sense” and figural reading strategies as well as historical criticism and its legacy.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
Scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities, recognize
where their own biographies place them in relation to the Hebrew
Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their individual
attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend their awareness
of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's long history of
reception. Finally, students should begin to infer what Jesus meant in
speaking of "the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms" (Luke
24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New Testament fulfilment of
scripture in light of the unique voice that the Old Testament retains
along side of the New in Christian Scripture.
