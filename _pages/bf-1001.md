*Fall 2024: Offered on AST's Campus and Online (Hybrid)*

### Course Description

The First Testament of Christian Scripture is a fundamental part of
Christian tradition and durable rule of faith and practice. Students in
this course will be introduced to historical and literary data important
for understanding the origins of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament and its
subsequent function as scripture in a variety of contexts. The outlook
will be broadly ecumenical, with case studies that exemplify Jewish and
Christian interpretation.

The broad sweep of biblical tradition will be presented through a survey
of representative books from the Law, the Prophets, and the Writings. To
help foster an ecumenical outlook, primary readings from the Bible will
be supplemented by illustrative commentary from various biblical
interpreters. Students will develop their exegetical skills by studying
these examples, and so learn to appreciate the diverse canonical,
cultural, hermeneutical, historical, literary, and theological elements
involved in the art of biblical interpretation.

- Prerequisites: None. Note that this course is a prerequisite for all 3000-level HB courses.
- Requirements: Weekly readings, weekly discussions, a presentation or two, a few short papers.

### Course Objectives

By the end of the course students should be able to:
	name major Old Testament people and events;
	locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
	give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the ancient Near Eastern political theatre from Egypt to Greece;
	recognize and cite examples of most genres of biblical literature;
	defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the Divine Name;
	understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
	report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets, such as the uses of the Divine Name or the rationales for sabbath observance;
	classify and begin to evaluate a variety of ancient and modern approaches to the Bible.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
Scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities, recognize
where their own biographies place them in relation to the Hebrew
Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their individual
attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend their awareness
of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's long history of
reception. Finally, students should begin to infer what Jesus meant in
speaking of “the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms” (Luke
24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New Testament fulfilment of
scripture in light of the unique voice that the Old Testament retains
along side of the New in Christian Scripture.
