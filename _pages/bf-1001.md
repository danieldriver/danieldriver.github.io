### Course Description

*From the Academic Calendar*: This course explores the First Testament
of the Bible as a foundational element of Christian religious heritage.
Students will be introduced to a progression of historical and literary
data important to understanding the Old Testament in its originating
cultural contexts and to considering its resonances in later cultural
contexts, including our own.

The broad sweep of biblical tradition and related historical
considerations will be presented in large part through guided study of
the course textbook. Each week we will also give close attention in
class to a particular textual instance, allowing students to develop
their exegetical and interpretive skills in a process that moves towards
integration of historical, literary and theological elements.

In addition, we will explore a range of practices—“things you can do
with the Bible”—thus encountering the Hebrew Bible in the context of
applications that have constituted much of its experienced liveliness
within faith communities over millennia. The Bible’s historical and
contemporary contributions to personal and communal spiritual formation
and practice come into focus here, and students are given an opportunity
to consider how the Bible might figure in formative ways within their
practice of ministry.

### Course Objectives

By the end of the course students should be able to:
	name major Old Testament people and events;
	give key dates for Israel's history and summarize the succession of superpowers in the Ancient Near Eastern political theatre from the time of Egypt to Greece;
	locate a few important biblical sites on a map;
	classify prophetic literature relative to the exile;
	recognize genres of biblical literature and cite examples from the reading;
	understand the general shape of the Masoretic Text tradition and differentiate it from other canonical orders;
	defend a decision to pronounce or circumlocute the divine name;
	report on parallel and divergent material across the Law and the Prophets;
	articulate multiple rationales for sabbath observance;
	memorize and recite ten verses of a psalm.

Students should also be able to identify settings in which the
scriptures of Israel are read (notably the synagogue, church, and
academy), employ terminology appropriate to these communities, recognize
where their own biographies place them in relation to the Hebrew
Bible/Old Testament and its uses, and monitor and test their individual
attitudes and assumptions. They should be able to extend their awareness
of the Bible's contemporary readers to the Bible's long history of
reception. Finally, students should begin to infer what Jesus meant in
speaking of "the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms" (Luke
24:44), and so learn to hear claims about New Testament fulfilment of
scripture in light of the unique voice that the Old Testament retains
along side of the New in Christian scripture.
