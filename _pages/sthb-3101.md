## Course Description

It is a painful irony that the Eucharist, once the form and instrument
of Christian unity, has become a point at which Christian division and
brokenness is most visible. Why is this so? Can the Eucharist once again
serve as an engine and sign of Christian unity? And, if so, how? This
course provides a space in which students can ask these questions and
begin to shape responses. It does so by o ering an account of the
problemâ€™s history and scope, and a set of biblical and theological
resources for the engagement of Eucharist theology in an ecumenical
setting.

The course has three distinct sections. First, we will explore the
Eucharist through the lens of scripture. Second, we will o er an
engagement with some key voices in Christian tradition. Finally, in the
third section of the course, we will facilitate an ecumenical
conversation about the role of the eucharist in the life of the Church.
This conversation will be informed by the scriptural and traditional
lenses we have engaged in sections one and two.
