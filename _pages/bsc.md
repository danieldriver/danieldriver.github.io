## Canon as Rule and Guide: Collected Essays (2023)

- Childs, Brevard S. [*Canon as Rule and Guide: Collected Essays*][FAT1]. Edited by Daniel R. Driver. Forschungen zum Alten Testament 1.174. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2023. xxxvi + 574 pages.

The fifty-two essays collected here span half a century of biblical scholarship. Together they provide a view into the history of Old Testament studies from the vantage of a scholar who worked to integrate his command of it with several cognate disciplines, including New Testament, Biblical Theology, and the history of interpretation. Canon is a rule and guide: this is a ubiquitous concern in the work of Brevard Childs. As he argues, scripture has been shaped with frameworks for interpretation, guidelines built into it through a complex editorial process that resulted in a multifaceted canon with two Testaments. Scripture is a canon and rule of faith that in turn shapes the church's confession and life of faith. This approach to scripture entails a holistic view that touches the Bible's composition and reception histories as well as its enduring claim on living communities of faith.

## Brevard Childs, Biblical Theologian (2010, 2012)

- Driver, Daniel R. [*Brevard Childs, Biblical Theologian: For the Church’s One Bible*][FAT2]. Forschungen zum Alten Testament 2.46. Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2010. Repr., Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2012. A revision of my doctoral thesis, the first edition was then corrected and further [expanded with English translations for a North American edition][Baker]. xiv + 354 pages.

In pursuit of the oneness of scripture's scope, Brevard Childs ranged across the Christian Bible, writing Introductions to the Old and New Testaments before attempting a landmark Biblical Theology of the same. For him the canon is a christological rule of faith, though perceiving the “family resemblance” in its historic formation and impress in the life of the church as well as, mysteriously, the synagogue, is always a great struggle. Yet Childs’s argument for final form exegesis rose out of his form-critical training: Hermann Gunkel is a crucial antecedent. Childs’s work has been much discussed, and in the wake of James Barr's criticism much misunderstood. Driver gives its total profile for the first time, from its background and controversy to its later development, analyzing all published titles and filling out this record with a number of previously unseen letters and papers.

### Development

This work advanced through several stages.

1. It started as a PhD thesis with a different title, defended in October 2008. The final submission is superseded but available from the University of St Andrews [research repository](http://hdl.handle.net/10023/754).
2. The [Mohr Siebeck edition][FAT2] took a new title, in part to reflect the revisions and new outline that developed in response to questions raised by examiners and editors.
3. [Baker Academic][Baker] commissioned a translation of all the German cited in the book, and published it in an [expanded North American edition][Baker].
4. A recapitulation of one of the work's main findings, drawn from chapter one of the book, appears in [SBL's 2013 *Gedenkschrift*](http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/061125P-front.pdf). You can [download it here](/assets/pdf/publications/Driver_2013.pdf).

### Excerpts from Reviews

> Daniel Driver has written a significant and subtle book which does
> justice to the complex and much-misunderstood oeuvre of one of the
> twentieth century’s greatest proponents of biblical theology…. I would
> judge that Driver's book is entirely successful on its own terms. The
> questions with which Childs wrestled are important ones, and Driver
> wishes us to wrestle with them, which has necessitated clearing out a
> huge amount of problematic secondary literature, striving diligently
> to capture a whole host of key conceptualities in careful language,
> and tracing once again the interwoven range of theological questions
> which occupied both biblical scholars (von Rad, Gunkel...) and
> systematicians (Barth, Frei ...) through much of the last century.
> Life is always easier when one collapses complex tensions one way or
> the other. Childs resisted such a path, and Driver calls us to stay
> with his work long enough to feel the force of the tensions for
> ourselves. One thus finishes the book eager for the sequel: where next
> for the biblical theologian?

> Driver offers rich and suggestive probes of the way in which Childs
> continued to think about midrash as a category for the text of the New
> Testament, engaged Jewish theological traditions (reflected especially
> in his Exodus commentary), urged the possibility of serious
> Jewish-Christian dialogue, and eventually voiced his understanding of
> the “mystery of Israel.” Driver’s judgments are sound, his learning is
> impressive, and his attentiveness to nuance in Childs’ work is
> reassuring.

> Driver has done a remarkable amount of research, examining Childs's
> work, including early student papers, lectures long buried in library
> audio archives, and personal letters. What Driver uncovers through
> this meticulous investigation is a general conceptual coherence among
> the various elements of Childs's work and a good deal of continuity
> throughout Childs's career, hopefully ensuring that future work will
> evaluate Childs on his own terms rather than in caricature.

> This detailed critique by D explores the historical course of the
> debate, provides a comprehensive bibliography of the most relevant
> sources, including important reviews, and traces as closely as
> possible the points that have aroused sharpest contention. The result
> is a book that is indispensable in showing why, since World War II,
> historical and theological approaches to the Bible have found it
> difficult to establish a common ground. It is part biographical and
> part methodological, looking beyond the work of one scholar to examine
> major questions about the use and interpretation of Protestantism's
> iconic book. It will certainly remain an essential work of reference
> for a while to come.

> In sum, this book gives a very detailed and extensive presentation of
> Brevard Childs's life work. Driver demonstrates clearly Childs's deep
> rootedness in German-speaking historical-critical exegesis as well as
> in the Barthian stream of the Reformed tradition. He clearly lays out
> Childs's lifelong struggle for a whole-biblical theology that on the
> one hand takes historical-critical work seriously but on the other
> hand also can make a distinctive and prescriptive contribution to a
> decidedly Christian theology. As a biblical theologian, Childs is very
> hard to pin down, thanks to his detailed processing of the positions
> with which he interacted: his lifelong critique of the
> history-of-religions school, the unfortunate (because based on
> misunderstanding) criticism of James Barr (and others), and Childs's
> delimitation of his own approach from apparently similar but actually
> opposed narrative-critical and intertextual Bible-reading strategies
> that run afoul of sound literary-critical method. Overall, this
> stimulating book presents Child's impressive and influential work to
> exegetes and theologians as an inspiration and encouragement to
> consciously differentiate and actively represent their Christian
> theological positions.

> This is an ambitious, multifaceted, and demanding study—much like
> Childs's own writings over the decades…. All with an interest in
> biblical interpretation that does justice to both critical and
> confessional realities are in Driver's debt for the most thorough
> breakdown to date of Childs's remarkable achievement in historical,
> exegetical, theological, and spiritual reading of Scripture.
