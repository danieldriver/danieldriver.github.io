### Forschungen zum Alten Testament II/46. Mohr Siebeck, 2010. Repr. Baker Academic, 2012.

This work advanced through several stages, reflected in four recensions.

1. It started as a PhD thesis under a different title, defended in October 2008. The final submission is superseded but available from the University of St Andrews [research repository](http://hdl.handle.net/10023/754).
2. The [Mohr Siebeck edition](https://www.mohr.de/en/book/brevard-childs-biblical-theologian-9783161503689) took a new title, in part to reflect the new outline that developed in response to concerns raised by examiners and readers.
3. Baker Academic commissioned a translation of all the German cited in the book, and published it in an expanded [North American edition](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/brevard-childs-biblical-theologian/336300).
4. A recapitulation of one of the work's main findings, drawn from chapter one of the book, appears in [SBL's 2013 *Gedenkschrift*](http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/061125P-front.pdf). You can [download it here](/assets/pdf/publications/Driver_2013.pdf).

### Excerpts from Reviews

> In sum, this book gives a very detailed and extensive presentation of
> Brevard Childs's life work. Driver demonstrates clearly Childs's deep
> rootedness in German-speaking historical-critical exegesis as well as
> in the Barthian stream of the Reformed tradition. He clearly lays out
> Childs's lifelong struggle for a whole-biblical theology that on the
> one hand takes historical-critical work seriously but on the other
> hand also can make a distinctive and prescriptive contribution to a
> decidedly Christian theology. As a biblical theologian, Childs is very
> hard to pin down, thanks to his detailed processing of the positions
> with which he interacted: his lifelong critique of the
> history-of-religions school, the unfortunate (because based on
> misunderstanding) criticism of James Barr (and others), and Childs's
> delimitation of his own approach from apparently similar but actually
> opposed narrative-critical and intertextual Bible-reading strategies
> that run afoul of sound literary-critical method. Overall, this
> stimulating book presents Child's impressive and influential work to
> exegetes and theologians as an inspiration and encouragement to
> consciously differentiate and actively represent their Christian
> theological positions.
