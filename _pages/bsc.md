### Forschungen zum Alten Testament II/46. Mohr Siebeck, 2010. Repr. Baker Academic, 2012.

This work advanced through several stages, reflected in four recensions.

1. It started as a PhD thesis under a different title, defended in October 2008. The final submission is superseded but available from the University of St Andrews [research repository](http://hdl.handle.net/10023/754).
2. The [Mohr Siebeck edition](https://www.mohr.de/en/book/brevard-childs-biblical-theologian-9783161503689) took a new title, in part to reflect the new outline that developed in response to concerns raised by examiners and readers.
3. Baker Academic commissioned a translation of all the German cited in the book, and published it in an expanded [North American edition](http://bakerpublishinggroup.com/books/brevard-childs-biblical-theologian/336300).
4. A recapitulation of one of the work's main findings, drawn from chapter one of the book, appears in [SBL's 2013 *Gedenkschrift*](http://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/061125P-front.pdf). You can [download it here](/assets/pdf/publications/Driver_2013.pdf).

### Excerpts from Reviews

> Daniel Driver has written a significant and subtle book which does
> justice to the complex and much-misunderstood oeuvre of one of the
> twentieth century’s greatest proponents of biblical theology…. I would
> judge that Driver's book is entirely successful on its own terms. The
> questions with which Childs wrestled are important ones, and Driver
> wishes us to wrestle with them, which has necessitated clearing out a
> huge amount of problematic secondary literature, striving diligently
> to capture a whole host of key conceptualities in careful language,
> and tracing once again the interwoven range of theological questions
> which occupied both biblical scholars (von Rad, Gunkel...) and
> systematicians (Barth, Frei ...) through much of the last century.
> Life is always easier when one collapses complex tensions one way or
> the other. Childs resisted such a path, and Driver calls us to stay
> with his work long enough to feel the force of the ten- sions for
> ourselves. One thus finishes the book eager for the sequel: where next
> for the biblical theologian?

> Driver offers rich and suggestive probes of the way in which Childs
> continued to think about midrash as a category for the text of toe New
> Testament, engaged Jewish theological traditions (reflected especially
> in his Exodus commentary), urged the possibility of serious
> Jewish-Christian dialogue, and eventually voiced his understanding of
> the “mystery of Israel.” Driver’s judgments are sound, his learning is
> impressive, and his attentiveness to nuance in Childs’ work is
> reassuring.

> Driver has done a remarkable amount of research, examining Childs's
> work, including early student papers, lectures long buried in library
> audio archives, and personal letters. What Driver uncovers through
> this meticulous investigation is a general conceptual coherence among
> the various elements of Childs's work and a good deal of continuity
> throughout Childs's career, hopefully ensuring that future work will
> evaluate Childs on his own terms rather than in caricature.

> This detailed critique by D explores the historical course of the
> debate, provides a comprehensive bibliography of the most relevant
> sources, including important reviews, and traces as closely as
> possible the points that have aroused sharpest contention. The result
> is a book that is indispensable in showing why, since World War II,
> historical and theological approaches to the Bible have found it
> difficult to establish a common ground. It is part biographical and
> part methodological, looking beyond the work of one scholar to examine
> major questions about the use and interpretation of Protestantism's
> iconic book. It will certainly remain an essential work of reference
> for a while to come.

> In sum, this book gives a very detailed and extensive presentation of
> Brevard Childs's life work. Driver demonstrates clearly Childs's deep
> rootedness in German-speaking historical-critical exegesis as well as
> in the Barthian stream of the Reformed tradition. He clearly lays out
> Childs's lifelong struggle for a whole-biblical theology that on the
> one hand takes historical-critical work seriously but on the other
> hand also can make a distinctive and prescriptive contribution to a
> decidedly Christian theology. As a biblical theologian, Childs is very
> hard to pin down, thanks to his detailed processing of the positions
> with which he interacted: his lifelong critique of the
> history-of-religions school, the unfortunate (because based on
> misunderstanding) criticism of James Barr (and others), and Childs's
> delimitation of his own approach from apparently similar but actually
> opposed narrative-critical and intertextual Bible-reading strategies
> that run afoul of sound literary-critical method. Overall, this
> stimulating book presents Child's impressive and influential work to
> exegetes and theologians as an inspiration and encouragement to
> consciously differentiate and actively represent their Christian
> theological positions.

> This is an ambitious, multifaceted, and demanding study—much like
> Childs's own writings over the decades…. All with an interest in
> biblical interpretation that does justice to both critical and
> confessional realities are in Driver's debt for the most thorough
> breakdown to date of Childs's remarkable achievement in historical,
> exegetical, theological, and spiritual reading of Scripture.
