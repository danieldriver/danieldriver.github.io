## Course Description

For students who wish to read, hear, and even (to an extent) produce
Hebrew, this course offers a textually immersive introduction to
classical Hebrew. Grammatical features like morphology, phonology, and
syntax are learned inductively, through a cycle of illustrated readings
drawn from Genesis. Techniques of second-language acquisition are also
used to help develop language competency. Continuation in HB 2202 is
strongly recommended. This course is open to AST students and to
Continuing Education participants.

Legacy: from Fall 2018

An introduction to the basic principles of biblical Hebrew with emphasis
on morphology, phonology, and syntax, this course is for students who
want to study the Old Testament in Hebrew. Students will learn basic
Hebrew grammar, develop a rudimentary biblical Hebrew vocabulary, and
begin to read the Hebrew Bible with one eye on the window it opens into
ancient Israel and another on its historic role as as scripture in
Judaism and Christianity. This course is suitable preparation for
further study in religion, theology, or classics. (It is open to
undergraduate and graduate students from other universities. Please
contact the AST Registrar to enroll as a Letter of Permission student.)
