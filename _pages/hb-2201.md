## Course Description

For students who wish to read, hear, and even (to an extent) produce
Hebrew, this course offers a textually immersive introduction to
classical Hebrew. Grammatical features like morphology, phonology, and
syntax are learned inductively, through a cycle of illustrated readings
drawn from Genesis. Techniques of second-language acquisition are also
used to help develop language competency. Continuation in HB 2202 is
strongly recommended. This course is open to AST students and to
Continuing Education participants.

*Prerequisites: None. The course is required for HB 2202 and advanced biblical Hebrew.*

*Requirements: Daily assignments and in-class work, periodic quizzes, one or two longer interpretive exercises or exams.*

## Required Texts (Summer 2022)*

LBH Grammar

: Note that LBH has a [companion site with resources for teachers and students](http://www.learningbiblicalhebrew.com/). You can order the [Learning Biblical Hebrew Bundle (2 vols.)](https://lexhampress.com/product/177582/learning-biblical-hebrew-bundle) directly from the publisher, in print or digital format. I would recommend getting the Reader in print format, since you want to write out the exercises, but it might be useful to have both formats of the Reader if you want to use a digital format for the Grammar.
