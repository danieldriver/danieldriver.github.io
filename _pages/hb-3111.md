## Course Description

From the creation of the world to the call of Abraham, and from the
promise of children to the establishment of the people Israel, the Book
of Genesis is one of the greatest origin stories ever told. Biblical
scholars today write about the “lost world” of Genesis, and so try to
account for the genesis of Genesis. There is indeed much to learn about
the history behind the first book of the Bible. The book has given rise
a major history of its own, however, and this history of reception has
lately become an area of interest in modern research. The history of the
text thus includes the question of how Genesis relates to the so-called
Abrahamic religions, and so invites ecumenical study. This course will
consider multiple approaches to the text. It ultimately seeks to
integrate what can be known about worlds behind and before the Book of
Genesis into a comprehensive theological vision that includes both its
prehistory and its role as Jewish and Christian scripture, from
antiquity down through the present day. Students will have an
opportunity to sample some of the best ancient and modern
interpretations of the book, and to develop their own expositions of it.
