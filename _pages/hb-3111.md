*Fall 2023: Offered On Campus and Online (Hybrid)*

## Course Description

From the creation of the world to the call of Abraham, and from the
promise of children to the establishment of the people Israel, the book
of Genesis is one of the greatest origin stories ever told. Biblical
scholars today write about the “lost world” of Genesis, and so try to
account for the genesis of Genesis. There is indeed much to learn about
the history behind the Bible's first book. The book has given rise a
major history of its own, too, and this history of interpretation has
become an area of interest in recent research. The history of the text
includes the question of how Genesis relates to the so-called Abrahamic
religions, and so the book also invites ecumenical and interreligious
study.

This course will consider multiple approaches to the Book of Genesis. It
seeks to integrate what can be known about worlds behind and before the
text into a comprehensive theological vision that includes its role as
Jewish and Christian scripture, from antiquity down through the present
day. Students will have an opportunity to sample ancient and modern
interpretations of the book, and to develop their own expositions of it.

The NJPS is the translation I will reference most in this course, though other modern translations like the NRSV will work.
