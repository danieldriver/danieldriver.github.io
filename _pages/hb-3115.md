*Offered in Summer Term 2018, Session Two (July 2 to July 13)*

## Course Description

Who is Moses, and what does his life have to do with Israel’s exodus
from Egypt and God's giving of the Law at Mount Sinai? This course will
examine the Moses story in the context of the Book of Exodus, attending
above all to the book’s canonical shape and its historic reception.
Students will also become familiar with some of the current debate about
the formation of the Pentateuch, particularly as it relates to different
accounts of Israel’s origins in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

*Requirements: Daily readings, daily discussions, a presentation, a final paper.*
