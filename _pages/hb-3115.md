## Course Description

Who is Moses, and what does his life have to do with Israel’s exodus
from Egypt? This course will examine the Moses story in the context of
the Book of Exodus, attending above all to the book’s canonical shape
and its historic reception. Students will also become familiar with some
of the current debate about the formation of the Pentateuch,
particularly as it relates to different accounts of Israel’s origins in
the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament.

*Requirements: Daily readings, daily discussions, a presentation, a final paper.*

*Meets in Summer Term 2018, Session Two (July 2 to July 13)*
