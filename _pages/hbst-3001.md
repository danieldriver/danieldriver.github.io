*Winter 2022: Offered at AST and Online (Hybrid)*

## Course Description

What is the relationship of scripture and theology? Some answers to this question start with the Bible, while others begin with Christian doctrine, while still others call for a dialectical movement between canon and creed. To illustrate the problems and possibilities, this course explores work by biblical and theological specialists who transgress the conventional limits of their disciplines. Specific doctrines under consideration may include: creation, sin, election, incarnation, divine impassibility, Christology, Mariology, law and gospel, death and resurrection, and the afterlife.

- Prerequisites: [BF 1001](../bf-1001/); TF 1001; RM 1000 or GTR 6000.
