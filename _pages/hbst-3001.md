*Winter 2022: Offered at AST and Online (Hybrid)*

## Course Description

What is the relationship of scripture and theology? Some answers to
this question start with the Bible, while others begin with
Christian doctrine, while still others call for a dialectical
movement between canon and creed. However it is approached, the
question presents a number of challenges.

To illustrate the problem in general, and to outline some possible
solutions, this course highlights a variety of current approaches to
the Old Testament as the scripture of the Church. Students will
encounter work by an array of biblical and theological specialists
who transgress the conventional limits of their disciplines. They
will study the views of Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and those who
disavow religious affiliation. Because the Hebrew Bible is Jewish
scripture in the first instance, students will consider why some
Jews are not interested in biblical theology, and what it means for
the Church to adhere to the Scriptures of Israel. Specific doctrines
under consideration include: creation, sin, election, incarnation
(the body of God), divine impassibility, Christology, Mariology, law
and gospel, death and resurrection, and the afterlife.
