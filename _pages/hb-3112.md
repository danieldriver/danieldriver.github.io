## Course Description

The Psalms have a special place in the life of the synagogue and church.
Thus a major goal of this course is to see how select psalms have fed
and informed Jewish and Christian theology in various periods: biblical
times, Rabbinic and Patristic periods, the Middle Ages, the Reformation,
the Enlightenment, and so on down to modern times. To help understand
the anthology’s unique arrangement, the course will also interact with
current research into the shape and shaping of the Psalter.

See “[Interpreting Psalms and the Psalter](https://danieldriver.com/2019/psalms-and-psalter/)” for some reflections on how I teach the psalms.
