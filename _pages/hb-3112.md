## Course Description

The Psalms of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament have a special part in the
life of the synagogue and church. A major goal of this course is
therefore to gain perspective on how the Psalter has fed and informed
Jewish and Christian faith in various periods: in biblical times,
Rabbinic and Patristic periods, the Middle Ages, the Reformation, the
Enlightenment, and finally the early and late modern periods. By
interacting with recent research into the shape and shaping of the
Psalter we will also consider the anthology’s arrangement. Study will
generally occur in one of two modes. First, secondary reading and class
discussion will look at hermeneutical and historical factors involved in
reading and understanding the Psalter. Second, seminars will help put
theory into practice by featuring about a dozen particular psalms in
connection with their reception history.
