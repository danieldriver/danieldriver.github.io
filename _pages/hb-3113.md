This course examines their ancient origins. It also considers the weight they have held for Jews, Christians, and others through an exploration of the Decalogueâ€™s reception history, in modes as diverse as liturgy, commentary, fine art, film, and popular culture.

*Requirements: Weekly readings, weekly discussions, a creative presentation, a major essay. This course includes an arts component worth at least 20% of the final grade.*
