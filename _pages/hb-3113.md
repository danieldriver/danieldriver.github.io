## Course Description

The first words spoken by God at Sinai and the leading terms of a
covenant sealed with blood, the Ten Commandments have been known as the
preeminent instance of biblical law. Less well appreciated is the
complex legal and cultic context that gave rise to multiple versions of
the Decalogue in ancient Israel, as seen in Exodus 20, Deuteronomy 5,
Exodus 34, and Leviticus 19.

This course examines the ancient origins of the Ten Commandments as a
premier example of the Bible’s legal traditions. It also considers the
weight that these laws have held for Jews, Christians, and others
through an exploration of the Decalogue’s reception history, which
includes modes of expression as diverse as liturgy, biblical commentary,
fine art, film, and popular culture. Finally, with ample time to
consider a commandment per week, the course invites students to reflect
creatively on the ethical trajectory of the commandments, their place in
contemporary religious life, and their stature in and beyond the
Christian Church.

*Requirements: Weekly readings, online discussions, a presentation, short and long papers. This course also includes an arts component worth 20% of the final grade.*
