*Winter 2022: Offered at AST and Online (Hybrid)*

## Course Description

As the first words spoken by God at Sinai and the leading terms of a covenant sealed with blood, the Ten Commandments are well known as a premier instance of biblical law. This course examines their ancient origins. It also considers the weight they have held for Jews, Christians, and others through an exploration of the Decalogueâ€™s reception history, in modes as diverse as liturgy, commentary, fine art, film, and popular culture.
