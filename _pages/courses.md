I teach a variety of courses at [Atlantic School of Theology](http://www.astheology.ns.ca/).
In addition to covering the basics for graduate- and undergraduate-level
survey and language requirements, I offer a rotation of courses from the
three parts of Tanakh by covering selections from the Law, the Prophets,
and the Writings.
