## Guides for Writing and Style

- In addition to the relevant [course syllabus](/courses/), students should refer to
  my [Guidelines for Papers (PDF)](/assets/pdf/handouts/Guidelines_for_Papers.pdf),
  a handout with generalized advice about how to succeed at the types of writing
  assignments I tend to give. (*Hint: do you have a strong thesis?*) The file also
  includes a copy of the rubric I use for paper analysis and assessment.

- *The SBL Handbook of Style*, 2nd Edition, is the definitive style manual for biblical
  studies and related disciplines. Details on correct citation may be found in:
	* A [book from SBL Press](https://www.sbl-site.org/publications/SBLHandbookofStyle.aspx)
	  and a [blog at sblhs2.com](https://sblhs2.com).
	* The free [Student Supplement (PDF)](https://www.sbl-site.org/assets/pdfs/pubs/SBLHSsupp2015-02.pdf),
	  which covers most of what you need to know to format a term paper.

- *The Chicago Manual of Style* is the foundation of SBLHS2, which is designed as a
  supplement. For questions of style that the SBLHS2 does not cover, consult the [CMS Online](https://login.proxy1.athensams.net/login?qurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chicagomanualofstyle.org%2F16%2Fcontents.html)
  and its handy [Citation Guide](https://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html).

- Style acts in service of effective writing. For guidance on research and writing
  I recommend two books in particular.
	* For a discipline-specific overview of the basics, see Margot Northey, Bradford A. Anderson, and Joel N. Lohr, *Making Sense in Religious Studies: A Student’s Guide to Research and Writing*, 3rd ed. (Don Mills, ON: Oxford University Press, 2019).
	  The book has sound, rudimentary advice on things like reading religious texts,
	  writing essays and book reviews, making oral presentations, and learning languages.
	  It should help you master fundamental tasks in nearly any course in religion or theology.
	  Order it in [Canada](https://amzn.to/2LKTIEf) (3rd ed) or the [USA](https://amzn.to/2K5kjXJ) (2nd ed).
	* For intermediate to advanced work, see Kate L. Turabian, *A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations*, 9th Edition, ed. Wayne C. Booth et al. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2018).
	  Serious researchers will want a copy of their own. Order it in [Canada](https://amzn.to/2PUjgB6) or the [USA](https://amzn.to/2DkSL0R).
