title: New job, new website
desc: I now work at the Atlantic School of Theology. Time for a refresh of this website.
---

Back in June I was appointed Associate Professor, Hebrew Bible / Old
Testament, at the Atlantic School of Theology. AST was extremely
professional throughout the interview process, and even put out a [press release][1] as soon as the news was official.

A new job merits a new website, or at least a refresh of the old one. In
this case I have updated several details from my outdated pages and
merged them with a fork of [clenemt's][2] simple but elegant theme for
[Jekyll][3].

Take a look around, and feel free to [let me know](/about/#contact) if
anything looks out of place.
