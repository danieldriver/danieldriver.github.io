Adriel and I are off to Paris to learn French for a month, studying at
the [ILCF - CUE](http://www.icp.fr/ilcf/)(in English
[here](http://www.icp.fr/ilcf/uk_index.php)). We expect a few visitors
already, so if you're in the area give a shout. We'll be on email (but
not on the blog!).

I do plan to make it to Vienna for the [canon/Kanon
session](/2007/06/sbl-vienna),
and perhaps to attend a special session in honor of Brevard Childs,
which may or may not happen on Wednesday morning.

I'm looking forward to unplugging myself from my workstation. Further
updates to this site can be anticipated in August,
though.
