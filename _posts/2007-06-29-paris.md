Adriel and I are off to Paris to improve our French by studying at the
[ILCF - CUE](http://www.icp.fr/ilcf/). We expect a few visitors already,
so if you're in the area give a shout.

I do plan to make it to Vienna for the Kanon seminar, chaired by Georg
Steins this year, and perhaps to attend a special session in honor of
Brevard Childs, which may or may not happen on Wednesday morning.
(Update: In fact the session did happen. James Kugel stood up and made
kind remarks about a former teacher and colleague.)
