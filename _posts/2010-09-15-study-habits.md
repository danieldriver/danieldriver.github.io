[Research Upends Traditional Thinking on Study
Habits](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=homepage&src=me):

The techniques recommended by the newer research are “alternating study
environments, mixing content, spacing study sessions, self-testing or
all the above.” Students, I recommend that you read the [whole article](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/07/health/views/07mind.html?pagewanted=1&_r=1&ref=homepage&src=me)
for yourselves. The beginning of a new year is a great time to think
about the kind of study habits you want to foster.
