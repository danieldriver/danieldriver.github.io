Anton Chekhov, it may surprise you to learn, had outlined a play based
on Ecclesiastes in a notebook (c. 1892). Would that it had been written.
A fragment, packed with allusions to the book, concentrates on the theme
of darkness:

> Solomon (alone) ‘Oh, how dark life is. No night during the days of my
> childhood has ever terrified me so much with its darkness, as has my
> incomprehensible existence. My God, you gave my father David only the
> gift to combine words and sounds, to sing and to praise you on a harp,
> to weep sweetly, to make others weep and to enjoy beauty, but why have
> you given me also a pining spirit and hungry thoughts which cannot sleep
> \[5:12; 8:16\]. Like an insect, born from dust \[3:20–1; 12:7\], I hide in
> darkness, in despair, trembling all over and growing cold with terror
> \[12:3, 5\]. I see an incomprehensible mystery in everything \[3:10–11,
> passim\]. Why does this morning exist? Why does the sun rise from behind
> the temple and gild the palm? Why are my wives so beautiful? \[cf. 2:8,
> 11\] Where does this bird hurry, what is the purpose of its flight, if it
> itself, its nestlings, and that place where it is hurrying must turn
> into dust, as I must? Oh, better not to have been born or to be a stone,
> to which God gave neither eyes nor thoughts \[6:3–5; cf. 4:2–3\]. To
> exhaust my body for the night, I spent all day yesterday like a simple
> worker, carrying marble to the temple, but now night has come and I
> cannot sleep \[5:12; 8:16\] … I will lie down once more. Forzes told me
> that if you imagine a running flock of sheep and think of it
> incessantly, your mind will get confused and fall asleep. I will do this
> …’ (He goes away.)

Then again, I can see why Chekhov never took the concept further. It is
interesting that some biblical scholars recommend thinking of
Ecclesiastes as a one-man play, though.



The citation comes from a 1968 study of the fragment by Peter
Rossbacher. I copy it as cited in Eric Christianson’s *Ecclesiastes Through the Ages*,
p. 68. Christianson highlights the biblical references in brackets.
