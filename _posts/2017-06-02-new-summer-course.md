title: New Course for Summer 2017
desc: Course pages and textbooks for my summer course on Doctrine and the OT.
---

I have put together some public and private resource pages for my Summer
2017 course at AST. I was asked to teach something that could be
cross-listed as Hebrew Bible and Systematic Theology (!), and so I took
my major inspiration from a new book by Gary Anderson. The course is:

* [HB/ST 3001: Christian Doctrine and the Old Testament](/courses/hbst-3001/)

Required textbooks for this iteration of the course include:

Anderson
