To my future students:

The Winter 2014 semester approaches, and it's not too soon to think
about the books you'll need. The Tyndale bookstore stocks all required
texts for Tyndale classes, and you can look up [classes by semester][1]
on their website.

Many people look for better prices online, and Amazon.ca does often
undercut our bookstore --- though they don't offer $50/class vouchers
for early registrants! If you go your own way, though, there is a risk
of picking up the wrong edition of a book. This has happend to students
before you, and it is not ideal.

Let me help you price shop and get the right books in a timely manner.
Below are all my required texts for Winter 2014, with links to
Amazon.ca. Their prices are current as of today.
