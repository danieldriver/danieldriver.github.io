While it is still 2007 I want to mention two new collections of essays
on canon ("kanon" in German). I've had the chance to work through them
both now, and have just submitted a review of the larger collection to
RBL. It should go up there sometime early next year.

The first to appear, in September, was Bernd Janowski, ed.,
*Kanonhermeneutik: Vom Lesen und Verstehen der christlichen Bibel*
(Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 2007). It contains essays from six
contributors.

The second, in November, was Egbert Ballhorn and Georg Steins, eds.,
*Der Bibelkanon in der Bibelauslegung: Beispielexegesen und
Methodenreflexionen* (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 2007). It contains 21
essays by 17 scholars. (Update: for more see my review, which is now
[available on RBL](http://www.bookreviews.org/BookDetail.asp?TitleId=6401).)
