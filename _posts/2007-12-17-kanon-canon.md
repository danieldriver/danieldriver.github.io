While it is still 2007 I felt I should mention two new collections of
essays on canon ("kanon" in the German spelling). I've had the chance to
work through them both by now, and have just submitted a review of the
larger collection to RBL. Since it has to be approved by the editors
first, I expect it will not appear there for a few months yet (but if
you're desperate for an English summary, feel free to contact
me).

The first to appear, in September, was Bernd Janowski, ed., *[Kanonhermeneutik: Vom Lesen und Verstehen der christlichen
Bibel](http://www.amazon.de/o/ASIN/3788722169/302-8582572-1538464?SubscriptionId=0NM5T5X751JWT17C4GG2)*
(Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener, 2007). It contains essays from six
contributors.

The second to appear, in November, was Egbert Ballhorn and Georg Steins,
eds., *[Der Bibelkanon in der Bibelauslegung: Beispielexegesen und
Methodenreflexionen](http://www.amazon.de/o/ASIN/3170191098/302-8582572-1538464?SubscriptionId=0NM5T5X751JWT17C4GG2)*
(Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 2007). It contains 21 essays by 17 scholars. I
quoted from this volume
[here](/2007/11/the-moratorium-on-canon)
recently, and I will certainly link my review once
[RBL](http://www.bookreviews.org/) processes it.
