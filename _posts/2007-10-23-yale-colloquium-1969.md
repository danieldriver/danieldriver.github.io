## From the 1969 Yale Colloquium on Karl Barth

In preparing for a seminar discussion I'm leading tomorrow, I dug up
some papers I haven't looked at for a while, including the rare
transcript of *Karl Barth and the Future of Theology: A Memorial
Colloquium Held at Yale Divinity School January 28, 1969*---held barely
a month after Barth died. Brevard Childs and Hans Frei were among the
panelists.

Charles Scalise made a lot of the piece in his dissertation on Childs
and Barth (1987), and again in a follow-up article in SJT 47 (1994):
61–88, which has sometimes been cited by those wishing to criticize
Childs by associating him with Barth. The Childs essay in question is
“Karl Barth as Interpreter of Scripture” (pages 30-39 in *Karl Barth and
the Future of Theology,* edited by D. L. Dickerman, New Haven: Yale
Divinity School Association, 1969). When I first tried to get my hands
on it, the librarian at St Andrews told me there was no copy in Britain.

Childs' essay was reworked in 1989, though it remains unpublished. (It
was pulled out again at the Beecher lectures, where Childs filled in for
[Lee Keck](http://www.librarything.com/author/keckleandere), who had
been in a car accident.) But what Scalise fails to mention about the YDS
colloquium volume is that, at the back, it includes a transcript of the
Q&A which followed the paper session.

It's really illuminating stuff. A while back I OCRed it (it appears to
have been transcribed from a cassette tape by a research assistant way
back). As I think virtually nobody has seen this, and because it's
chatty, informal, fun and highlights a number of important points, I'm
posting the dialog here.

### Points of note:

1.  Childs lines up with Frei (indeed, partly learns from Frei) on "the
    heart of the problem: that for Calvin, the *sensus literalis* IS
    Jesus Christ. And it was only when you have the eighteenth century
    identification of the literal sense with the historical sense that
    you’re just hopelessly lost."

2.  When they say this (Frei: "That's right.") others seem not to know
    what they're talking about.

3.  Allegorical readings can't be dismissed out of hand for either
    Childs or Frei.

4.  But when it comes down to a few finer details, Childs differs from
    Frei on the matter of reference.

5.  Specifically, for Childs the "ontology" issue is about "the
    scope of the canon; namely, the reality which is in dialectic with
    the text, defined by its canonical context. I don’t see how you can
    avoid a dialectic between text and reality, in some sort."

6.  For Childs, this is why "the new hermeneutic is not only mistaken,
    but it one colossal *cul de sac*."

7.  1969 is incredibly *early*—the year before Childs' *Biblical
    Theology in Crisis*, and five years before Frei's *Eclipse of
    Biblical Narrative.*

### The full discussion (minus a few digressions):

> **STUDENT**: I have a question. You’ve commented tonight on the
> truthfulness of Barth’s use of scripture. You’ve commented on the
> wide-ranging homiletical force of much of his writing. But when you
> look at it closely enough in some respects in some places, it is not
> textually predicated or warranted sometimes, and may even sometimes be
> allegorical. How do you appropriate, still, some of this live genius
> that’s there, and yet at the same time remain more controlled by the
> text? That would probably be one question.
>
> And the second question would be, Do you see any person on the horizon
> who shows promise of being as crucial, as forceful, and yet takes more
> seriously what the text is saying—controlling himself at this point
> more than Barth?
>
> **BREVARD CHILDS**: Well it seems to me for the last twenty or thirty
> years people have been trying to combine the orthodoxy of Barth with
> the historical-critical approach. It seems to me that this enterprise
> has now come to and end and has proven unfruitful—that you are now at
> the turn of the road, you have to go either right or left; that the
> type of move that said Barth is right in seeing theological dimension,
> but now we have to take history more seriously and bring in the whole
> baggage—I don’t think this can—
>
> In other words, I’m suggesting that the problem is far deeper than
> this. It’s a problem that certainly didn’t just arise with Barth. (And
> much of what I’ve learned about this has come from talking with Hans
> Frei.) But it has often bothered and puzzled me. You see, when you
> read Calvin, he fights against the whole medieval tradition by saying
> it’s the sensus literails that counts—it’s the literal sense—and you
> have page after page against the whole church dogma. But then you read
> Calvin on the Old Testament, and here’s Jesus Christ and Jesus Christ.
> How could it possibly be? And everybody just says that Calvin is just
> inconsistent.
>
> It seems to me that this doesn’t at all touch the heart of the
> problem: that for Calvin, the sensus literalis IS Jesus Christ. And it
> was only when you have the eighteenth century identification of the
> literal sense with the historical sense that you’re just hopelessly
> lost. And it seems to me that it’s something along that line—that
> we’ve just been unable to understand what Barth is doing.
>
> **HANS FREI**: That’s right.
>
> **JULIAN HARTT**: Would you mind repeating that?
>
> **CHILDS**: It sounds better in German, though.
>
> **STUDENT**: Is it something we can do today?
>
> **FREI**: Sure, because you see \[tape unintelligible\] in his exegesis
> he’s looking at the text. He’s not looking through the text at the
> person who wrote it. He is, I think, a highly literal reader—what’s
> set before you there—whereas I noticed that one goes back (in
> questioning his exegesis) constantly to and earlier version of Barth
> that he pretty clearly forsook very soon: namely, the Barth for whom
> the letter became transparent and pointed him to something deeper,
> something else.
>
> I think, because one thing about Barth is that he’s very much
> controlled by the letter—no spirit without letter—very much controlled
> by the letter, and in regard to that and historical criticism, he
> simply made the move: when you’re doing historical criticism, you’re
> doing a pretty fine thing, I’m sure. But it’s just logically different
> from reading the text, burrowing under it, and cropping out all over
> it, lots of nice things. And I’m sure that there’s an awful lot of
> illumination to be gained by that. But you’re not reading the text,
> you see. Barth reads the text. It cannot be qualified with other
> things.
>
> In Scripture we know that when we read a story, a historical
> investigation of the story is a very good thing to do. But we need to
> know how that text works, what’s in the text. And though we have a
> hard time describing how we do that, in fact when we compare about
> what we think it says we often find that we can agree on things, and I
> think fundamentally it is as simple as that. That’s how it works for
> Barth.
>
> **SALIERS**: . . . \[But the\] assumption that we can treat things as a
> literary whole which gives us a certain critical concept of
> literalness, which we can then employ, is a thing that the Biblical
> people, at least the ones who knit their brows when you said that, are
> probably worrying about.
>
> **CHILDS**: Well, it’s a real problem. I wouldn’t go quite with Hans
> in this direction. It seems to me that the problem came up very early
> in church history when Jerome attempted to translate the Bible from
> Hebrew. Augustine called him into question. He said the New Testament
> and the Church is receiving the Old Testament in terms of the
> Septuagint, and therefore this is the context and there’s no use going
> behind it. You can’t go behind it. And Jerome of course just killed
> him at this point in defending the need for seeing the original
> context.
>
> Here, it seems to me that both had a point. Obviously, Augustine was
> right in taking seriously the fact that the Old Testament had taken
> another form and had assumed another context by being passed through
> the Septuagint. But Jerome obviously was right in claiming that the
> next context of the church did not obliterate the older context in
> which it was seen. In other words, what I’m saying is that the problem
> that remains the most thorny one is how the various contexts relate.
> And Barth, in criticizing the historical critics’ insistence that you
> read the original context but take seriously the
> theological-confessional context, it seems to me, is in the
> danger—just as Augustine—of obliterating the need for dealing with the
> original context.
>
> \[. . . After a few minutes, the discussion returns to Childs’
> differences with Frei.\]
>
> **CHILDS**: But you see \[Barth\] doesn’t use the term “context,” but he
> talks about the canon, namely: that Scripture is the apostolic,
> prophetic testimony all linked together. Don’t go behind this, don’t
> separate it. And this is a context; in other words, this is a
> theological context—
>
> **ROBERT JOHNSON**: You’re speaking, then, of the historical context
> that Barth says is in the word “history.”
>
> **CHILDS**: No, no. That’s the whole point: that Barth objects to
> everyone who does this.
>
> **JOHNSON**: So, from the point of view of what Hans is arguing, what
> he’s really talking about is not the historical context but the
> literary context.
>
> **CHILDS**: That’s where Hans and I differ somewhat. I move in a
> little different direction here. In other words, it seems to me that
> there are problems when you get—I would agree fully with Hans when
> he’s combatting those historical critics who would want to go behind
> the text, but it’s interesting when you begin to deal with the
> narrative text, as a context. One has to keep in mind that the early
> church, in the controversy with Judaism, took quite a different move.
> When the Jews were saying, read the text! read the text!, the
> Christians said, there’s something behind the text. It’s what the text
> points to, namely: Jesus Christ. And there was a dialectic between the
> reality and the text.
>
> It seems to me, what buttresses this from getting into the kind of
> ontology you’re talking about is the scope of the canon; namely, the
> reality which is in dialectic with the text, defined by its canonical
> context. I don’t see how you can avoid a dialectic between text and
> reality, in some sort.
>
> \[. . . The conversation turns to a student, Johnson and Frei
> momentarily.\]
>
> **CHILDS**: It seems to me that this question about the Jesus that
> Paul—excuse me, that Barth—raises, was very much a part of the mood of
> the early churchmen. They are concerned: How do you know what the Old
> Testament is talking about? You hear the Gospel; that is, the
> dialectic between old and new. Who is Jesus? You don’t get it just
> from reading the narrative of the Gospel. That’s the whole point that
> the early church worked on: He’s the Servant; He’s Suffering Israel;
> He’s the eye of the Sun; all this sort of thing. It seems to me,
> therefore, that I fully agree that the new hermeneutic is not only
