On Tuesday, February 13th – a date picked before anybody thought to ask how early Shrove Tuesday might fall in 2024 – my university, AST, is hosting a celebration and launch of [Brevard S. Childs’s collected essays](/bsc/), which I finished editing and Mohr Siebeck published last year. But to me it now seems like a great way to mark FAT Tuesday (FAT being the standard abbreviation for the series in which the volume appears, *Forschungen zum Alten Testament*). If you’re interested and available, by all means come along.
