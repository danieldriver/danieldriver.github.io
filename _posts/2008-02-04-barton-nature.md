Over the weekend I finally read John Barton's [The Nature of Biblical
Criticism](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/066422587X?ie=UTF8&tag=danrdri-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=066422587X).
I had picked it up at SBL last summer, in Vienna, and skimmed parts of
it thereafter, but I only just blocked out time to read it carefully
from cover to cover.

I resist the urge to say much about it yet, or even to rate it. I'll
have to interact with the book in my dissertation and I don't want to
pre-empt what I'll say there. I do note, however, that [this
essay](http://www.oup.co.uk/academic/humanities/religion/obc/bib_schol/)
of Barton's, which originally heralded*The Oxford Bible Commentary* in
September 2001, anticipates themes in the book at several points. This
is especially true of the last two sections, "A Turn to Theology" and
"'Advocacy' Readings." Under the former, for instance, Barton states

> Every so often there is a movement to ‘reintegrate’ biblical studies
> and theology, or to ‘give the Bible back to the Church’. I personally
> believe that scholars have never really taken it away from the Church,
> and have often indeed been if anything too ‘reverent’, avoiding hard
> critical questions. But there can be no doubt that many people do feel
> there is a division between the scholar in the study and the
> worshipper in the pew, with the preacher in the pulpit uneasily wedged
> between them. And a repeated reaction to this perception has been to
> try to develop some way of making biblical study more ‘theological’.

Similarly in the book he concludes: "There is a battle going on at the
moment between those who believe that biblical criticism is too much in
the grip of a secular and skeptical spirit and those who think it has
still not managed to escape the hand of ecclesiastical and religious
authority. My sympathies lie on the whole more with the second group"
(185).

Barton's dissent from the many advocates of theological exegesis makes
his new book essential reading for those with an interest in the same.
He sees his program as closer to the essence of true religious reading,
which makes it especially provocative. That his thoughts show evidence
of long reflection (themes from his classic *Reading the OT* \[1984\] are
also present in 2007) makes the argument all the more important.

Of course, not all will agree with Barton's diagnosis, let alone his
prescription. Regarding canonical approaches he writes (in the online
essay, but again in line with the book):

> Older biblical criticism was often practised by scholars who did have
> a high commitment to the inspiration and authority of Scripture. But
> they thought the proper way to study it was first to analyse it
> critically in the ways I have described, and only then to move on to
> questions of its religious significance. This was true of Catholic and
> Protestant biblical scholars alike. The newer movement denies that
> this division of labour is desirable, or even possible.

But practitioners of the canonical approach are likely to reply that any
division of labor will be different simply because the task envisioned
is different. In short, Barton's work aims at the very core of the
confessional exegesis movement (if it is proper to speak of such a
thing). In particular he targets Brevard Childs, Chris Seitz, Francis
Watson, and Walter Moberly. And debate with these figures (indeed,
*among* them) has long been underway.

Finally, I understand that a response to Barton's book, by Moberly, is
already due to appear this year in
[JTI](https://www.eisenbrauns.com/jti) (issue 2/1). One hopes that
engagement from all parties will turn up fresh soil where the ground has
already so often been plowed.
