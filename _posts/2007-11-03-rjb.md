As has been mentioned, [Richard
Bauckham](http://richardbauckham.co.uk/) retired from
his post as Bishop Wardlaw Professor of New Testament this last
Wednesday. I wanted to comment it sooner, but it took me a while to
upload the photo of him fielding questions on his last day in the
Biblical Studies seminarâ€”a seminar he founded at St Andrews sometime
after his arrival here 15 years ago. It's been a privilege to learn from
him.

The book we've been discussing for the last four sessions is Bauckham's
[Jesus and the
Eyewitnesses](http://www.eerdmans.com/shop/product.asp?p_key=9780802831620).
If you feel you're missing out, you can have a look at the blog series
[Chris
Tilling](http://www.christilling.de/blog/2006/11/jesus-and-eyewitnesses-outline-of.html)
ran on the book, or on the same site an [interview about it with
Bauckham](http://www.christilling.de/blog/2006/11/richard-bauckham-on-jesus-and.html).
I hear the book is about to go on tour: first at
[Gordon-Conwell](http://www.gcts.edu/communications/2007/bauckham.php),
then at both ETS and SBL in San Diego. Details for the SBL panel review
of the book are as follows:
