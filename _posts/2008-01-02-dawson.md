Over the holidays I re-read one of the first books I tacked for this
PhD, namely, John David Dawson's *[Christian Figural Reading and the Fashioning of Identity](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0520226305/?tag=ot-scripture-20)*.

Dawson’s tightly written book is one of the more intriguing comments on
supersessionism I know. And as an exploration of its core concern,
Christian figural reading, I know nothing else quite like it. It sets
three modern concerns about figural reading---the body (represented by
Daniel Boyarin), history (Erich Auerbach), identity (Hans Frei)---all
against a treatment of Origin, that ancient, infamous allegorizer,
chosen for what he has to say to those who would read Hebrew Scripture
as the Christian Old Testament. The book repaid a second reading every
bit as much as the first.
