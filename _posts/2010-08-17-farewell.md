For those who missed the excitement over Ron [Hendel’s
farewell](http://www.sbl-site.org/membership/farewell.aspx) to SBL, it
is now too late to comment. The forum in SBL’s membership pages closed
yesterday. This afternoon I skimmed the accumulated 95 posts, by
quantities known and unknown, looking for anything that might be useful
for classroom use.

The best I could find was by Alan Cooper.

I remember that session last November, and Cooper’s contribution in
particular. It was stimulating.
