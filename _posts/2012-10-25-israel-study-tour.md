at Tyndale during the Winter 2013 semester.

Instructors:

* Tyndale Seminary: Dr. Rebecca Idestrom

Please note that this course can count as either a New Testament

## Course Description

This course is a study tour which combines travel with lectures and
readings to provide students with a rich, on-site learning experience.
Students will spend three full weeks in Israel visiting sites throughout
the country that formed the stage on which so many biblical events
were played out. Our tour will move region-by-region, spending time
in Jerusalem and Judea, Benjamin, the Coastal Plain, the Negeb, the
Dead Sea area, the Jordan Valley, the Galilee and the Golan Heights.
In each area students will learn about its geography and archaeology,
exploring how the features of each area shaped the history of its
people. Attention will also be given to the imagery and symbolism
connected with each region in both the Old and New Testaments.

Please be aware that this is a physically demanding course, which will
involve significant amounts of walking in a hot climate.
