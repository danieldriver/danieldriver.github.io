The notion of a "rule of faith" governing the Church's Scriptural Interpretation has been a matter of recent historical debate among scholars of the early church, but also many theologians working in our difficult pluralistic settings. The fall colloquium will offer substantive contribution to this debate about scriptural and theological norms in the early church and beyond.

Presentations by:

* **The Very Rev. Dr. John Behr** (St. Vladimir's Seminary)
* **Dr. D. Jeffrey Bingham** (Dallas Theological Seminary)
* **Dr. Mark Elliott** (The University of St. Andrews)
* **Rev. Dr. Christopher Seitz** (Wycliffe College)
