Pope Benedict XIV’s two-part volume on Jesus, which traces his life “historically” even as it describes him theologically and in a way that is congruent with traditional Catholic dogma, has proven both an extraordinarily popular work and one that has challenged biblical scholars in various critical ways. Several Protestant scholars here work with Benedict’s second volume (“Holy Week”) and discuss it with a Catholic theologian.

Presentations by:

* **David Trobisch** (Nussloch/Springfield, MI)
* **Terence L. Donaldson** (Wycliffe College, Toronto)
* **Joseph Mangina** (Wycliffe College, Toronto)
* **Gilles Mongeau, S. J.** (Regis College, Toronto)
