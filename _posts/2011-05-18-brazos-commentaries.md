Wycliffe College is pleased to inaugurate its new **Wycliffe Centre for Scripture & Theology** (WCST) with a two-part colloquium on 13 and 14 May 2011.

Wycliffe College is a vital institution of Christian teaching and learning, engaging scholars, seminarians, masters and doctoral students across the theological disciplines. Among its special commitments is the intellectual renewal of Scriptural and Theological study as a mutually informing discipline in the service of the Christian Church.

The Wycliffe Centre for Scripture and Theology will serve this purpose by:

* Offering regular for-credit seminars on the theological study of Scripture, which will include exegesis, hermeneutics, history of interpretation, and Scriptural theology.
* Organizing regular colloquia at Wycliffe---one per semester---that will bring a leading scholar and several younger scholars together with faculty and Advanced Degree students for discussion of current work being done in these areas.
* Foster an atmosphere among interested faculty and students at Wycliffe and the Toronto School of Theology that strengthens scholarly collegiality and mission.

The subject of the first WCST colloquium is "The Character of Theological Exegesis in the Brazos Bible Commentary Series: An Analysis and Critique." The Friday session includes presentations by:

* **Prof. Christopher Seitz** (Wycliffe College, Toronto)
* **Prof. Daniel Driver** (Tyndale University College)
* **Prof. Anthony Cummins** (Trinity Western University)
* **Prof. Mark Elliott** (St. Andrewâ€™s University, Scotland)
* **Prof. R. R. Reno** (Editor, First Things, and Editor-in-Chief, Brazos Bible Commentaries)
